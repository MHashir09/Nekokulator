# Nekulator ˚₊•

Nekulator is a cat theme based basic calculator with some cool features. The word "Nekulator" is derived from 2 words. One being a japanese word "Neko" which means "Cat" and the other being calculator. So them combined (neko+calculator) becomes Nekulator, I came up with this name myself hehehe.

## Features:

Some unique features of Nekulator that makes it more unique than other javascript based basic calculators are:

- Divide by 0 : It can properly show MATH ERROR if you try to divide by 0. As dividing by 0 is one the first edge cases you tackle while making a calculator.
- Unary Support : It properly supports unary (+/-) operators. Not only does it support it, it also displays them inside parenthesis like (-1) on Nekulator's screen providing better readability for users.
- Arbitrary Amount Of Operators : Instead of only supporting a pair of operands and one operator (1 + 1), it supports arbitrary amount of operands and operators like (1 + 1 + 2...etc).
- Different Themes : Nekulator also has 2 different themes. A light and a dark theme. To change themes on Nekulator, click the "Sleeping Cat" icon in the top center of the Nekulator. Also you can try changing theme to dark here also by clicking the "Change Current Theme" button below and vice versa.
